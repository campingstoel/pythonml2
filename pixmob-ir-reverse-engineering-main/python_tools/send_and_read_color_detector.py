# as described by sean1983 here: https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering/issues/8
# This version goes through each color in the input file, sends it out, reads a also a simpler version that sends
# each command once and then tries to read the color right after, in the hope that they held the color for long
# enough after transmission for us to read it.
# There's another version that sends the color command constantly for a few seconds and reads the color sensor
# value in the middle.
